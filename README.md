# Discord FeedBuddy

## Description
This is a Discord bot that helps organizers and community members will engage in their servers. The bot curates the content you want from specified channels in a server. On servers that have added this bot, users can save specific channels under their profile. Then, the bot periodically sends those users content/messages tailored to them. For example: popular messages from those channels, messages that include the user's name/role, or messages that contain keywords that each user had chosen. Additionally, users may call the bot to generate analytic reports about the engagement in the current server.

## Commands

Commands are run on the server or in the DM with the bot. Some commands can only be run specifically in a channel or in the DM.

### DM-Only

These commands can only be run when in a DM with the bot. They include most of the settings command, such as adding/removing keywords or setting the period that the bot sends messages.

### Analysis

The following describes the options that can be used with `!get-analytics`:

- timeline: Sends a png photo of a line graph that compares the number of posts per day across all channels in the server.

- engagement: Sends a png photo a pie chart that compares users' relative engagement on the server. Engagement is based on the number of posts, how well-received those posts are, and how often user's react to the posts of others.

- nojson: Does not send the JSON file that contains server information to the user. By default, the JSON is sent.
